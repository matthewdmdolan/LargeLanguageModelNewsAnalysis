# Newscatcher API - A Rpad to More MEaningful News? 

Ultimately, I tried not to read the news during the big C as a self defence mechanism. Whilst I've reacclimated post big c, I came up with the idea of a project to help keep me more informed on some areas of interest that I've bene neglecting, 
alongside using NLP methods to identify some more meaningful news sources in areas that I have kept in the loop about. 


This product leverages the Newscatcher API and sentiment analysis techniques to identify more meaningful news sources. Moreover, an SQLite database is used to store data for future analysis.
